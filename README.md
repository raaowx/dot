## CLI

### Shell

The folder contains all common configurations for all CLI I usually use. In those files you will find all my environment variables, aliases, functions, etc.

### Bash

The folder contains all my configurations for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell.

### Zsh

The folder contains all my configurations for [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) shell.

The folder contains my configuration for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor and the list of extensions I use. Yeah! I know VSCode can handle [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) for me, but I don't like the way it's done. I prefer to have all configurations in the same repository.
